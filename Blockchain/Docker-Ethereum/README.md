# Docker Ethereum Network



I have a project in which I use some Raspberry Pi to form a cluster of nodes and participate in a private Ethereum network.
In the process, I have hardened the raspbian lite distribution and installed the software necessary in a master node, then, 
I replicated the hardened installations over the network with an Ansible Playbook. 

The Ethereum nodes form a network of Docker containers, all started up with a Composer command.Â
